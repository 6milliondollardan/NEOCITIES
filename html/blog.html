              <p>DUDE OMFG WE HAVE A THREE DAY WEEKEND. This is phenomenal. Thank you Christopher Columbus for owning too many slaves to have a day named after you or some shit. Because three day weekend means three days to hang out and be totally rad!!!!!
                <br>
                Me, Xozy, Molly, and Javi are planning a sleepover for Sunday - Monday, but it might not be happening. Praying it does because oh my fucking GOD I need a sleepover. I haven't had one in god knows how long. Ya boy needs to sleep in the same room as one of his homies for once.
